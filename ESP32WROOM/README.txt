# ESP32 Photo Server with Custom Carrier Board

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a **custom ESP32-based photo server** with a fully designed carrier board, capable of capturing images via a camera module, storing them locally, and serving them over Wi-Fi through an HTTP interface.  
The system integrates **hardware design, firmware development, and IoT connectivity**, and was later used as the foundation for a **hands-on workshop** where participants built and programmed the system from scratch.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Custom ESP32 Carrier Board**
  - USB-C power input with voltage regulation
