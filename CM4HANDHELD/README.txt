# Raspberry Pi CM4 Handheld Console with Custom Carrier Board (Prototyped on NVIDIA Jetson Nano)

## üìå Overview
This project is a **custom handheld gaming console** built around the **Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4)**, featuring a fully designed carrier board with integrated power management, display interfaces, audio, input controls, and expansion capabilities.  
Early-stage **prototyping and subsystem validation** are performed on the **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** to accelerate development, test Linux-based application layers, and refine display, input, and audio integration before final CM4 deployment.  
The system combines **embedded hardware design**, **Linux-based system integration**, and **custom firmware configuration** to create a portable gaming device capable of running retro and modern emulators.
